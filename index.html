					<h2>Welcome!</h2>
				
				<p>Hi Everyone! My name is Hermy L. Rigor. I'm 19 years old and I am in Second Year college. I'm a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) Student and also a Transferee at CVCITC.</p>
				<p>My purpose of doing this Home Page is for my Final Activity Exam at CC101 subject who are under with Mr. Denward Mating. I'm also doing this Homepage to entertain myself and remember what I learned about HTML in the meantime, and I'm starting to learn other programming languages like CSS, which I used today to design my Web Page.</p>
				<p>To learn more about me, simply click on the links on the upper left that interest you.</p>

							<h2><p align= "center">Playing BasketBall</h2></p>
							<p>Basketball is my all-time favorite pastime! I became involved in basketball because I was interested in the sport, and I began playing it every day after finishing my senior year of high school. Basketball is a great way to exercise while also having fun with friends and possibly making new ones. Basketball is a very entertaining sport that anyone can play, and I enjoy watching and playing it. Basketball is regarded as a good pastime by many, but it is also regarded as a passion by many others.</p>

						<h2><p align= "center">Playing Online Games</p></h2>
						<p>I usually don’t use the term hobby, but I play quite often. Gaming is my way to relax. I spend my free time playing games online with my friends and it’s the way I connect with my friends. Gaming means to me a lot. I think I could not live without my phone! My inspiration for gaming began when I watched live streams on Facebook a long time ago. My first online game that I have played is Mobile Legends: Bang Bang. I was allowed to play in the tournament in our barangay and I didn't continue because of my roles in other things. The second I am currently playing is Call of Duty Mobile. I am currently playing in the RSC clan (Red Syndicate). Because of the clan I joined, I was also given the opportunity to compete against the top clans in tournaments such as NRX Clan, VvV and many more. But I can't play right now because my cellphone is broken. But I still hope that I can come back and continue playing.</p>
