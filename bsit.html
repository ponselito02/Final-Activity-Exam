					<p>The computer information technology course combines the advantages of a traditional college education with the advantages of hands-on training in cutting-edge computer technology. Students not only gain technical proficiency, but they also learn to write well-organized and clear memos and reports. The computer information technology curriculum combines technical knowledge with communication skills, a strong general education, and a breadth of knowledge in the field of computer information technology.</p>
					<p>The Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) program trains students to be IT professionals who can install, operate, develop, maintain, and administer computer applications. The program's goal is to prepare students to be "information technologists" who can help individuals and organizations solve problems using information technology (IT).</p>
					<p>The BSIT program teaches students the fundamentals of conceptualizing, designing, and implementing software applications. It also offers training in the development of office support software (word processing, spreadsheets, databases, and accounting), intranet and internet, and specialized professional software (multi-media, website development and eCommerce). It also provides a foundation in mathematical and computing principles.</p>
					
					
					<h2>Role of BSIT in Medical Field</h2>
					<p align="justify"><p>IT is the use of computers and telecommunications equipment to store, retrieve, transmit, and manipulate data, typically in the context of a business or other enterprise. Today, information technology is used in a wide variety of fields, including medical science, which is known as Health Information Technology (HIT).</p>
					<p><b>Health information technology (HIT)</b> is an application of information processing that involves both computer hardware and software and is concerned with the storage, retrieval, sharing, and use of health care information, data, and knowledge for communication and decision making. HIT, or health information technology, refers to computers and communication capabilities that can be networked to create systems for moving health information. Let's take a quick look at the history of information technology in medicine.</p>
					<p>With the advancement of technology, there has been a significant shift in medical education around the world. The majority of medical students are now computer literate, which is a significant change. New medical information is easily accessible via the Internet and handheld computers such as palmtops and personal digital assistants (PDA). Information technology, such as college networks and the internet, can help medical education in a variety of ways. Some options include computer-assisted learning (CAL), virtual reality (VR), and human patient simulators. Medical students and teachers can stay in touch even when they are not in school thanks to college networks and the Internet.</p>

					<h2>Role of BSIT in Human Space Exploration</h2>
					<p align="justify"><p>IT plays a unique role in human space exploration because it is an infrastructure technology that enables other technologies and capabilities. This means that IT applications must be considered as a whole rather than in isolation. IT is a cross-cutting infrastructure technology that affects many areas, including Lifecycle Design, Ground Operations, Transportation, and Surface Operations. IT affects different aspects of the problem, such as increasing safety, increasing efficiency, increasing performance, and decreasing cost, in addition to many application areas. Some of these aspects are interrelated, such as lowering costs and increasing safety, and are frequently at odds. There are two primary areas to consider when assessing the potential impact of IT on human space exploration: increasing safety and decreasing cost. There are IT applications areas that stand out as having the most impact in each of these areas. Vehicle Health Management is the IT application with the greatest impact for increasing safety. The IT applications with the greatest impact in terms of cost reduction are Automated Assembly and Automated Operations.</p>
