					<p>Technology is something I've been interested in for as long as I can remember, so choosing to study IT at CVCITC was an easy decision. I'm frequently asked why I chose this subject, and the answer is simple: technology never ceases to amaze me, and fortunately, I was born in the right generation to keep up with it and witness its impact on the world. Problem solving is the most appealing aspect of technology to me. Problem solving has always been a challenge for me, from completing puzzles at home to programming at school. Because there was an unhappy perception that a career in technology was not a typical choice for me, my mother wanted me to get a Bachelor of Secondary Education Major in Filipino because she saw the potential in me because of my poetry work, and I've tried to take what they want for me. But I gradually realized that I didn't like it and told my parents that I wanted to study technology. Over the years, I was asked many times who inspired me, but it was difficult to pick just one person.</p>
